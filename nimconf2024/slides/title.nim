Hi! My name is Constantine, and I've been using Nim as my primary language for hobby development for over a decade.

Today, I'd like to talk about applying Nim in frontend development. My goal is to show that Nim isn't just a viable option for frontend development (this is not news) but an option you can actually compare to the mainstream frameworks like React or Vue in terms of usability, reusability, app size, and programmer's experience.
